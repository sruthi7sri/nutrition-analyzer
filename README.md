# Nutrition Analyzer

## Inspiration
Many consumers struggle to decipher nutrition labels, making it difficult to make informed dietary choices. Misleading claims, hidden ingredients, and a lack of personalized guidance often lead to unhealthy eating habits. The **Nutrition Analyzer** was created to simplify nutritional awareness using AI and provide users with personalized health insights effortlessly.

## What It Does
The **Nutrition Analyzer** is a smart web application that allows users to:
- Upload an image of a nutrition label to extract key details using AI.
- Input dietary preferences and allergies for personalized analysis.
- Get an instant health classificationâ€”healthy, moderately healthy, or unhealthy.
- Receive detailed nutritional summaries, including calories, macronutrients, and ingredients.
- Get allergy warnings based on user input.
- View daily intake recommendations for better dietary decisions.

## Technology Stack

| Task | Technology |
|-------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Extract text from image** | Python (FastAPI), PyTesseract, Image Preprocessing (TBD) |
| **Convert extracted text into structured JSON** | T5 Base (Summarization), DistilBERT (Classification) |
| **Score food based on FDA/WHO guidelines** | Python (AST API, Pandas), OpenFoodFacts Dataset |
| **Build user interface for image upload & results** | HTML, CSS, JavaScript |
| **Connect frontend to backend via API calls** | Flask/FastAPI (Backend), Fetch/Axios (Frontend) |
| **Host and manage backend** | GitHub |

## How We Built It
- **Image Processing & AI:** Used machine learning models (such as DistilBERT) to extract text from nutrition labels and analyze them.
- **Web Application:** Frontend built using HTML, CSS, with backend powered by JavaScript and FastAPT.
- **Health Classification Algorithm:** Implemented a system to categorize food items based on extracted nutritional data.
